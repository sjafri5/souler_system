<h5>The market place today...</h5>

<p>...has saturated with competition. The cutting edge is not really cutting much anymore. In current state of consumerism, the much sought satisfaction and meaningfulness crumbles so fast into irrelevance that we seem to have acquired the same curse that the crew of the black pearl (in the movie 'Pirates of the Caribbean') had. Like addicts, the more we use, the less it satisfies and the more we need. And this endless negative cycle, in an ever-tightening grip, is literally strangling us to our own demise with our own devices.</p>


<p>The future trends of current "material" feeding-frenzy are showing no signs of abating, rather all of us can see an exponential upward increase. Picture this...China, India, Brazil, that's roughly two-third of the world population, are now already a rapidly swelling tsunami of producers and consumers...no stopping them now. Soon to be followed by many currently third world countries. Imagine the strain on world's natural-socio-economic-political environment on ever-reducing global resources. Its not a matter of 'if', its a matter of 'when' this rat-race will escalate to survival race. The possibility that our grand children will inherit a dying planet has already began to snarl at us.</p>

<h6>What can we do? How can we possibly stop it?</h6>

<p>The answer is that there is no need to stop it. Just a paradigm shift in our collective consciousness can (and will) steer us around this otherwise evergrowing blackhole of self devouring consumption. That shift lies in heightened awareness of our own selves, our incredibly priceless each moment of life, our responsibility and stuff like that. We, at Souler System, call it 'souler awakening'. Yes, we have heard this kind of talk before but the real meaningfulness and the relevance of it hasn't yet set in public consciousness. Souler System is committed to continue to work on it till its meaningfulness becomes so obvious and compelling that the general public naturally adopts it and the higher living becomes a main stream reality. Once that happens...markets, governments and laws will follow the general public...the global citizenry.</p>


<p>We, at Souler System, are not commited to this work just because it sounds good but rather because we actually see that the insights that we have, when applied in correct spirit, can (and will) go viral and become the main force to avert the looming doom...it might work slowly at the beginning but surely it will catch on. That inner insightful lifestyle is simply far more meaningful and far more satisfying than any external commodity can ever deliver. These powerful insights are to be freely share with leadership of businesses and their staff, so that it can transform the way we all look at (and do) our businesses and take our businesses on a new, much integrated with the rest, and yet to be realized levels.</p>

<h5>LEADERSHIP<h5>

<p>...need to have a fresh orientation on what 'profit' really means. The visions of business leaders need to shift from 'money' to something much better than that...for example, "aligning with universal goodness"...the moment you tune your products/services/brands to universal context, the forces to steer ourselves away from the total meltdown of good life will begin to come into play. New much fulfilling, deeply meaningful and higher niches are about to emerge...Business leaders who understand, create and prepare these new niches will thrive, the businesses that won't, will fizzle out. Business leaders who pay attention to clients that have awaken and have countless new needs will venture into new dimensions, new plains, new heights. New market opportunites will abound. Money will flow-in naturally and be a bi-product...not the prime product. If done right, the floodgates of money will naturally open as the humanity's craving for higher meaningfulness is stirred.</p>

<p>Leaders must invest in this new, higher view, higher living life-style. Shift the consciousness of the humanity towards it...making it a main stream phenomenon will do the trick. Endless new opportunities, niches, needs will surface in the market place...all adding to the growth of true humanity.
